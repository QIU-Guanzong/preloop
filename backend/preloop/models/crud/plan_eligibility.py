"""Whether one account can switch to one plan, and what the switch costs it.

The console used to answer this with adjectives. It offered every catalog
plan as a target, then hedged with "not enough evidence to confirm a fit" and
a permanent retention warning shown to accounts with no data old enough to be
deleted. A reader could not tell from that whether Pro was a mistake for a
four person account (it is: Pro includes one user) or whether switching would
delete anything (usually it would not).

This module answers with numbers instead, so the console renders text it did
not compose:

Refusals (``eligible`` false)
    Seats and agents, because those two are gates the platform actually
    enforces. An account with four members cannot hold a one member plan: the
    seat gate refuses the next invitation, and the switch would strand it.

Consequences (``eligible`` stays true, a warning carries the number)
    The monthly ingestion quota and analytics retention. Exhausting the
    ingestion quota degrades analytics detail and never blocks agent traffic,
    and a shorter retention window deletes old analytics, which a reader may
    legitimately accept when downgrading. Refusing either would trap an
    account that wants a cheaper plan; saying nothing would delete data by
    surprise. So they are stated, with the date and the count, and the reader
    decides.

Nothing here reads the plan catalog: limits arrive as :class:`PlanLimits`
from whoever owns the catalog (the EE billing plugin at runtime, a fixture in
tests), so a price or limit change in ``plans.yaml`` never needs a code change
here and no test can pin yesterday's numbers.
