"""Decide whether an automatic triage delivery has anything to assess.

Triage reads an issue's title and description. A provider ``issue_updated``
delivery that changes neither (a GitLab assignee, milestone or due-date edit,
which GitLab reports as a plain issue update because it has no separate
assignment hook) gives the assistant nothing new to read, so a run on it costs
a model call and rewrites the same assessment.

The gate is deliberately scoped to flows that came from the issue-triage
preset. Other flows keep every ``issue_updated`` delivery, including the
GitLab assignment edits that normalize to no other event type.

This is relevance filtering at the trigger boundary, not durable per-revision
coalescing: two deliveries that both change the description still start two
runs once the first one finishes. See issue #448.
