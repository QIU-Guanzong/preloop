"""Write gateway search-corpus rows off the response path.

The gateway used to build and write a search document while it still held
the request and response bodies of the call it had just served. That put a
text pass and a database round trip between the upstream response and the
point where the payloads became garbage, on the pod with the tightest
memory budget in the deployment (issue #670).

What runs on the response path now is only
``GatewayUsageSearchService.build_index_document``, which reads the payloads
once and returns a bounded document: an id, at most ``MAX_TEXT_CHARS`` of
text and a small metadata dict. That document is handed to this queue and
the payloads are free. A single worker thread drains the queue with its own
session, so the write cannot hold the request session, cannot slow the
response, and cannot turn a successful model call into an error.

The queue is bounded on purpose. If indexing falls behind, dropping
documents is the correct failure: the corpus is an opt-in convenience, and
memory pressure is the exact problem this exists to avoid. Drops are
counted and logged.
