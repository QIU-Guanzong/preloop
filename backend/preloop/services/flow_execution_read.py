"""Reading one execution from inside an agent turn: ``get_execution`` (#632).

``run_flow`` (#630) returns the moment a child execution row exists, so a
parent that wants to know how its child ended has to ask again later. This
module is that read: it answers with the same A2A shaped task record the
delegation call answers with (#625), so a parent polls the shape it was
already handed rather than a second vocabulary.

The read is scoped, and the scope is the whole point. An execution id is a
UUID a model can invent, so nothing here trusts one:

1. the calling execution is resolved from the runtime identity, never from a
   tool argument;
2. the target is loaded account scoped, so an execution of another account is
   not readable and not even distinguishable from one that does not exist;
3. the target must be the caller itself or a descendant of it, established by
   walking ``parent_execution_id`` upwards to the caller.

Everything that fails any of those three is refused with one reason,
``execution_not_found``, and one message. A sibling, an unrelated execution of
the same account, an execution of another account and a UUID nobody ever
issued are answered identically on purpose: a differentiated refusal is an
existence oracle, and one that a model could walk through an account with.

The result payload is bounded rather than trusted too:
``FLOW_DELEGATION_RESULT_MAX_BYTES`` caps what one call may return, and a
larger result comes back truncated, flagged, and with a pointer to the full
document instead of pasted whole into the caller's context.

Not here, on purpose: reading an arbitrary execution of the account, listing
executions, streaming or subscribing, and evidence archives. Waiting for a
child is #633.
