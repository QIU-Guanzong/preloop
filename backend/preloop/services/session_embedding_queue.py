"""Bounded in-process queue that drives the session embedding worker.

The corpus is written on request paths that must not wait for a provider.
Those paths hand an account id to this queue and return; a single worker
thread drains it with its own database session and embeds one batch per
submission.

Bounded means a full queue drops work rather than blocking a request thread.
Dropping is cheap here in a way it is not for most queues: the backlog is
durable in ``session_search_document`` (the chunks stay ``pending``), so a
dropped submission costs a delay, never a vector. Blocking instead would put
the memory and latency of the embedding backlog on the pod serving agent
traffic, which is the whole thing this design avoids.

Submissions are deduplicated by account: one busy account cannot fill the
queue with its own id and starve every other account's backlog.
