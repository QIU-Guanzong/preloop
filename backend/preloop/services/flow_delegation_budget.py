"""What a delegation tree is allowed to cost, and what it has cost so far (#631).

``flow_delegation_call`` decides whether one execution may start another.
This module decides whether the account can afford it. The two are separate
on purpose: every other delegation rule answers from a flow definition, this
one answers from money already spent and money already promised.

The shape of the answer, which is the whole design:

* Every delegated child is admitted under a **ceiling**, in USD. The agent
  may ask for one (``max_cost_usd``), the calling flow's ``callable_flows``
  entry may cap what the agent may ask for (``max_usd_per_child``, #627),
  and an instance default applies when neither says anything.
* A ceiling covers a **subtree**, not one run. A child admitted at 5 USD may
  spend 5 USD itself, or spend 2 and let its own children spend 3. That is
  what stops a cap being avoided by delegating one level deeper.
* A tree nobody delegated (a root run) is covered by the instance ceiling
  ``FLOW_DELEGATION_MAX_TREE_USD``.
* A child is refused **before it starts**, never killed once it is running.
  A child killed halfway has already been paid for and produced nothing, so
  a ceiling reached after a child started is a ceiling that binds the *next*
  child, not the ones already running.

Because a running child has spent less than it will spend, an in flight
child counts at its ceiling (what it may still cost) and a finished child
counts at its actual ``estimated_cost`` (what it did cost). Counting a
running child at its current spend would admit a second fan out on the
strength of work that has not been paid for yet.

Not a budget policy: ``BudgetPolicy`` (account, flow, api key, managed
agent) is untouched, and every existing budget rule still applies to every
execution in a tree exactly as it applies to a run nobody delegated. This is
an admission rule layered on top of them, which is the option #621's open
decision 4 offers as an alternative to inventing a ``tree`` subject type.
