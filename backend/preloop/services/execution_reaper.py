"""Policy for the stale-claim reaper: who runs a pass, and how often a row
may be republished.

The reaper is the deploy-handoff safety net: it re-publishes executions whose
owning worker died so another worker adopts them. Its defect was that
"nobody has claimed this" and "nobody has a free slot for this" look the
same from the database, and that every replica ran the same pass. On
2026-09-15 three replicas republished sixteen unclaimed executions every
thirty seconds, about ninety publishes a minute into a queue that could not
absorb one of them.

Three bounds live here:

* a lease, so one pass runs per interval whatever the replica count
  (``preloop.models.crud.crud_flow_execution.stale_claim_reaper_lease``);
* a per-execution backoff that doubles from the reclaim interval up to a
  cap, persisted on the row so every replica reads the same schedule;
* a capacity probe, so a pass that cannot possibly be drained is skipped.

Nothing here decides whether an execution is *stale*. That stays with the
claim heartbeat: the backoff only decides how loudly the reaper may repeat
itself about a row that never gets claimed.
